---

## Quickstart

Get up and running in three commands:

```bash
# 1. Set up the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pika
pip install -e .

# 2. Run a full experiment (this launches sandbox + vLLM + eval + judge grading)
python orchestrate.py --config configs/experiments/gpt_oss_deepsearchqa.yaml
```

Or if you want more control, start the services separately:

```bash
# Start services in the background
python orchestrate.py --config configs/experiments/gpt_oss_deepsearchqa.yaml --services-only

# Then run eval and judge independently
python evals/eval.py --config configs/experiments/gpt_oss_deepsearchqa.yaml
```

### Programmatic use

You can also import and use the agent directly in Python:

```python
from trajectorykit import dispatch

result = dispatch(
    user_input="Compare the populations of Tokyo and New York City",
    turn_length=10,
    verbose=True,
)

print(result["final_response"])
result["trace"].save()  # Saves to traces/trace_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_uuid.json + .html
```

### Performance Breakdown by Refinement Stage

| Metric | Agent Output<br/>(GPT-OSS-20B) | +Requirement Refinement<br/>(GPT-5.4 Pass 1) | +Synthesis & Clarity<br/>(GPT-5.4 Pass 2) | +Finding-Based Rewrite<br/>(*3) | Total Improvement |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Comprehensiveness | 0.4548 | 0.5260 | 0.5390 | **0.5412** | +18.9% |
| Insight/Depth | 0.4397 | 0.5701 | 0.5800 | **0.5828** | **+32.5%** ⭐ |
| Instruction Following | 0.5071 | 0.5260 | 0.5303 | 0.5289 | +4.3% |
| Readability | 0.4899 | 0.5247 | 0.5308 | **0.5325** | +8.7% |
| **Overall Score** | 0.4696 | 0.5407 | 0.5496 | **0.5508** | **+17.3%** |

**Refinement pipeline workflow:**
1. **Agent Output** (GPT-OSS-20B): Foundational research harness
2. **Stage 2** (Requirement Refinement—GPT-5.4): Systematic coverage and mechanistic depth
3. **Stage 3** (Synthesis & Clarity—GPT-5.4): Natural narrative structure and calibrated signposting
4. **Stage 4** (Post-Processing Chain): Running the external [`post_process_chain.py`](https://github.com/KabakaWilliam/deep_research_bench) tool—finding-based rewrite emphasizing key insights through improved subheadings and strategic section organization
5. **→ Judge Evaluation**: Report is then graded on comprehensiveness, insight, instruction-following, and readability

**Critical workflow note:** The final report **must** be passed through the post-processing chain (Stage 4) before submitting to the judge. This step is essential for achieving the performance gains shown.

**Key insight:** The baseline (GPT-OSS-20B alone) reaches 0.4696 on Deep Research Bench before any refinement, showing that much of the performance comes from the harness rather than a large multi-model stack. The four-stage pipeline cumulatively improves performance by 17.3%, with finding-based rewriting contributing +0.12 points in overall score while maintaining strong synthesis depth.

## Why TrajectoryKit?

TrajectoryKit is built for researchers who want full control:

- **Minimal-model design.** Achieve competitive PhD-level research quality with an open-weight 20B model locally deployed. Optional GPT-5.4 refinement layer (not required), cutting inference costs while competing directly with proprietary agents.
- **One config, one command.** Single YAML file specifies everything: model, GPU setup, vLLM config, sandbox, dataset, judge. Then `orchestrate.py` handles the rest—pulling images, launching services, evaluation, and grading.
- **Full transparency and reproducibility.** Every turn is recorded (searches, fetches, code execution, agent decisions) and saved as interactive HTML traces. Build on a locally-deployed harness you fully control.

**Deep Research Bench Configuration Note:** The diagram above reflects the production setup for evaluating on Deep Research Bench. Chain analysis and rubric generation use GPT-5.4 (external) to design high-quality evaluation criteria before research begins. The research loop itself runs on gpt-oss-20b (local) for efficiency. Quality auditing (Stage 1) uses GPT-5.4 (external) with the rubric to guide depth assessment, while spot-check verification and citation audit use local models to minimize cost at scale.

### Key design decisions

| Concern | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Model flexibility | In bench mode (Deep Research), specific models are assigned: chain analysis and rubric generation use external GPT-5.4, research loop uses local gpt-oss-20b, Stage 1 quality audit uses external GPT-5.4, and Stages 2–3 use local models. In general mode, most LLM steps accept either external or local as drop-in replacements via `verifier.stage1_provider` and `verifier.stage2_provider` config. Configure via `model.name`, `model.api_url`, and verifier block. |
| Causal chains | Before dispatch, the LLM reads your question and detects multi-step dependencies. We build a `ChainPlan` that enforces sequential execution — if a step depends on an earlier result, we block it until that result exists. |
| Verification | Five-stage pipeline (rubric generation + 4-stage verification): First, create a rubric defining sub-questions, coverage checklist, source requirements, hallucination traps, and insight bar. Then after publishing: format gate → Stage 1 quality audit (8 criteria: adequacy, language consistency, depth, comprehensiveness, section quality, citations, coherence, conflicts/gaps) → Stage 2 spot-check (extract claims with external model, verify with local sub-agents in parallel, compare with local judge) → Stage 3 citation audit (verify URLs support claims). Fail paths loop back with rubric feedback. |
| Cycle prevention | Five safety gates prevent infinite loops: can't publish without a draft, can't republish without revising, can't draft without researching, must follow the plan once it's active, and in report mode can't publish without a second research phase after the first draft. |
| Context management | When the conversation gets long, we automatically trim old messages but keep the system prompt and recent turns. Tool outputs get stashed in an external `MemoryStore`, and synthesis sub-agents can query them by running code. No context is ever wasted. |
| Search resilience | The default search chain is Serper → Exa.ai → DuckDuckGo. Set `SEARCH_BACKEND=parallel` to opt into Parallel Search MCP, with the existing providers as fallbacks. |
| Fetch resilience | Four-tier fallback for fetching URLs: direct HTTP, then Jina Reader for JS-heavy sites, then Exa's content API, then Wayback Machine for archived versions. |
| Draft workflow | The root agent writes drafts using the `refine_draft` tool and publishes via `research_complete`. We keep all draft versions, and the verifier gives feedback if your answer lacks depth or insight. |
| Budget management | As you approach the turn limit, we send informal warnings at 5, 3, 2, and 1 turns remaining. On the final turn, the agent can only use `final_answer` to wrap things up. |
| Trace fidelity | Every turn is fully recorded: what the LLM said, which tools it called and with what arguments, the results, wall-clock duration, any child traces from sub-agents, and token usage. |

## Experiment Configs

Define everything in one YAML file. Here's an example:

```yaml
# configs/experiments/gpt_oss_deepsearchqa.yaml

model:
  name: "openai/gpt-oss-20b"
  api_url: "http://localhost:3030/v1"

vllm:
  port: 3030
  gpu_devices: [2]
  gpu_memory_utilization: 0.9
  tool_call_parser: "openai"
  reasoning_parser: null
  extra_args: ["--async-scheduling"]
  env:
    TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR: "/VData/resources/huggingface/tiktoken-cache"

sandbox:
  url: "http://localhost:8080/run_code"
  port: 8080
  sif_image: "sandbox-fusion_server-20250609.sif"
  docker_uri: "docker://volcengine/sandbox-fusion:server-20250609"

agent:
  max_recursion_depth: 1
  sub_agent_turn_budget: 10

dataset:
  name: "google/deepsearchqa"
  split: "eval"
  sample_n: 100
  seed: 42

eval:
  turn_length: null          # unlimited
  reasoning_effort: "high"

judge:
  enabled: true
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini"
  threads: 5
```

Then just run:

```bash
python orchestrate.py --config configs/experiments/gpt_oss_deepsearchqa.yaml
```

The orchestrator does the heavy lifting:

1. Pulls container images from Apptainer and starts the sandbox
2. Launches vLLM with your model, GPU setup, and parser configuration
3. Waits for services to be healthy
4. Runs evaluation on your dataset
5. Grades results with the LLM judge (if enabled)
6. Leaves services running so you can iterate

Results are saved to `data/` as parquet files with per-item and aggregate metrics.

---

## Running Evaluations

### Quick Start: One Command

```bash
# End-to-end: services → eval → judge → scoring
python orchestrate.py --config configs/experiments/gpt_oss_deepsearchqa.yaml
```

### Available Benchmark Configurations

| Benchmark | Config | Model | Dataset |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| **DeepSearchQA** | `gpt_oss_deepsearchqa.yaml` | GPT-OSS-20B | Google DeepSearchQA (~100 samples) |
| **Deep Research Bench** | `gpt_oss_deep_research_bench.yaml` | GPT-OSS-20B | Deep Research Bench (100 PhD-level tasks, 22 domains) |
| **Alternative: Qwen** | `qwen3_deepsearchqa.yaml` | Qwen3-8B | Google DeepSearchQA |

**Model Flexibility:** All configs default to minimal-model approaches (20B or 8B open-weight). You can swap in heavier models (e.g., GPT-5.4, Claude-3) by modifying the `model.name` and `model.api_url` fields in any config.

### Evaluation Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["📊 Config"] --> B["🎯 Start Services"]
    B --> C["🧪 Run Evaluation"]
    C --> D["💾 Save Traces"]

    F --> G["✅ Results Ready"]
    G --> H["data/results.parquet"]
    G --> I["results_judge_ratings.json"]
```

### Standalone Usage

For more control, run evaluation components separately:

```bash
# Just eval (no judge)
python evals/eval.py --config configs/experiments/gpt_oss_deepsearchqa.yaml

# Just judge (on existing results)
python evals/llm_judge.py --results data/google_deepsearchqa/gpt_oss_20b/results.parquet

# Recover parquet from trace JSONs (if eval crashed mid-run)
python evals/recover_parquet.py
```

### Evaluation Output

- `results.parquet` — Per-item metrics, token counts, latency
- `results_judge_ratings.json` — Judge scores with per-metric breakdowns
- `traces/` — Full JSON + HTML traces for each query

---

## 🔄 Post-Processing Chain: Batch Article Refinement

For batch processing of draft articles (e.g., multiple reports from research runs), use the `post_process_chain.py` script to apply the same four-stage refinement pipeline described in the Evaluation Results section.

### Setup

`post_process_chain.py` is at the TrajectoryKit root level. It imports refinement prompts from `deep_research_bench/`, which you clone separately:

```bash
# Clone deep_research_bench for the refinement prompts
git clone https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench.git

# Install its dependencies (if any)
cd deep_research_bench && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

From TrajectoryKit root:

```bash
# Process a directory of drafts
python post_process_chain.py \
  -i ./my_drafts/ \
  -o ./refined_articles/ \
  -c 3  # 3 concurrent refinements

# Process JSONL file
python post_process_chain.py \
  -i research_results.jsonl \
  -o refined_results.jsonl

# Use data from the cloned deep_research_bench
python post_process_chain.py \
  -i deep_research_bench/data/sample_articles/ \
  -o ./refined/
```

### The Four Refinement Stages

1. **→ REWRITE_OG** — Quantify vague claims, fill entity gaps, strengthen causal reasoning
2. **→ REFINEMENT_V2** — Add mechanistic depth, ground abstractions in examples, deepen analysis
3. **→ REFINEMENT_V3** — Natural narrative clarity, calibrated signposting, scannability improvement
4. **→ REFINEMENT_V3_B** — Finding-based subheadings, strong topic sentences, decision-relevance threading

Each stage preserves all existing content while adding specificity, context, and structural clarity.

### Options

- **Input:** Directory of `.md`/`.txt` files OR JSONL file (one JSON object per line)
- **Output:** Same format as input (directory or JSONL)
- **Concurrency:** Control parallelization (default: 2 workers)
- **Providers:** OpenAI (recommended: GPT-5.4 with reasoning_effort: high) or Anthropic
- **`--test`:** Process only the first record (useful for testing)

### Full Documentation

See [deep_research_bench/POST_PROCESS_CHAIN_README.md](https://github.com/KabakaWilliam/deep_research_bench/blob/main/POST_PROCESS_CHAIN_README.md) in the external repository for detailed usage examples, API provider configuration, and development guide.

## Tools

### Root tools (orchestrator only)

These tools are available only to the root orchestrator agent:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|----------|
| `conduct_research` | Spawn a sub-agent to research a specific topic. The sub-agent gets its own context, tools, and trace. |
| `refine_draft` | Write or completely replace the draft report. Each call overwrites the previous version. |
| `read_draft` | Look back at previous draft versions and any feedback the verifier left. |
| `research_complete` | Publish the draft and trigger the 4-stage verification pipeline. |
| `summarize_webpage` | Fetch a URL and get an LLM-generated summary focused on a topic. Faster than spawning a sub-agent for quick reads. |
| `think` | Reasoning scratchpad — the LLM can think out loud here without showing it to the user. |
| `search_available_tools` | Self-introspection. List all tools or get the full schema for a specific one. |

### Worker tools (sub-agents)

Sub-agents have access to these tools for research and fact-checking:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `search_web` | Search the web with Serper → Exa.ai → DuckDuckGo by default. Set `SEARCH_BACKEND=parallel` to select the keyless Parallel Search MCP with automatic fallbacks. |
| `fetch_url` | Fetch a page with four-tier resilience: direct HTTP → Jina Reader → Exa contents → Wayback Machine. Supports `css_selector` for targeted extraction and `extract="table"` mode for structured data. |
| `read_page` | Scroll through cached page text from a previous `fetch_url` call — no new network requests. |
| `extract_tables` | Parse HTML tables from a URL and return them as structured JSON (array of dictionaries). |
| `read_pdf` | Download and extract text from a PDF. |
| `wikipedia_lookup` | Look up a Wikipedia article via the MediaWiki API. Returns the article text, section list, and structured infobox data. |
| `fetch_cached` | Retrieve an archived version of a URL from the Wayback Machine. |
| `execute_code` | Run code in a sandboxed environment (Python plus 40 other languages). Supports base64 file upload and download. |
| `recall_memory` | Retrieve previously stored tool outputs by key. Query across the compressed memory for specific data. |
| `spawn_agent` | Recursively spawn a sub-agent with fresh context and its own trace. |
| `final_answer` | Submit the final answer and terminate the loop. |
| `think` | Reasoning scratchpad for internal deliberation. |

---

## Tracing

Every `dispatch()` call produces a complete execution trace with every turn, tool call, and decision recorded.

### Terminal output

Get a quick summary in your terminal:

```python
result["trace"].pretty_print()
```

  Total tokens:        14,270
```

### JSON + HTML

Save the full trace as self-contained JSON and HTML:

```python
result["trace"].save()
# → traces/trace_20260219_210429_154b9f2e.json
# → traces/trace_20260219_210429_154b9f2e.html
```

The HTML viewer is fully interactive: collapse and expand turns, view reasoning content, inspect tool calls and their arguments, see inline images (stored as base64), and check token counts and latency per turn.

## Configuration

Settings are loaded from a YAML config file with a fallback chain: explicit path → `TRAJECTORYKIT_CONFIG` environment variable → `configs/default.yaml` → built-in defaults.

### Key config sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `model` | Which model to use and where to find it (name and API URL) |
| `vllm` | Server port, which GPUs to use, memory utilization, parser type, extra launch flags |
| `sandbox` | Sandbox service URL, port, container image, Docker URI |
| `agent` | Max recursion depth, sub-agent turn budget, verification settings, context compaction rules |
| `model_profiles` | Per-model overrides: context window, temperature, reasoning effort |
| `prompts` | Paths to system prompt files (orchestrator, worker, synthesizer, etc.) |
| `dataset` | HuggingFace dataset source, split, sample count, random seed |
| `eval` | Turn limit, reasoning effort, verbosity |
| `judge` | Whether to run grading, which judge model, how many threads |

### Environment variables

You need to set a few API keys depending on which features you're using:

| Variable | What it's for |
|----------|---------|
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | Default web search provider (Serper.dev). Falls back to Exa or DuckDuckGo if not set or credits run out. |
| `SEARCH_BACKEND` | Optional search provider selector: `serper` (default), `serpapi`, `exa`, `ddg`, or `parallel`. |
| `EXA_API_KEY` | Exa.ai for neural search (fallback) and content fetching. Highly recommended. |
| `JINA_API_KEY` | Jina Reader for fetching JavaScript-heavy or paywalled pages. Optional but improves success rates. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for rubric creation and post-processing rewrite (GPT-5.4). Only needed for those features. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key for alternative post-processing rewrite (Claude Opus). Optional. |
| `SERP_API_KEY` | Legacy SerpAPI key (alternative search backend, requires setting `SEARCH_BACKEND=serpapi`). |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Gemini API key. Only needed if you're using Gemini as the judge model. |

When `SEARCH_BACKEND=parallel`, TrajectoryKit uses the [keyless, rate-limited Parallel Search MCP](https://docs.parallel.ai/integrations/mcp/search-mcp) at `https://search.parallel.ai/mcp`. Search queries are sent to Parallel. Requests identify the project with the `trajectorykit/0.2.0` User-Agent for aggregate MCP usage measurement; it does not contain a user or installation identifier.

#### Setting up your `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the **project root** with your API keys:

```bash
# .env (at root of trajectorykit/)
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_key
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_key
JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
# Optional: select the keyless, rate-limited Parallel Search MCP.
# SEARCH_BACKEND=parallel
```

The framework automatically loads these when you run `orchestrate.py` or call `dispatch()`.

## `dispatch()` API

Call the agent directly from Python:

```python
from trajectorykit import dispatch

result = dispatch(
    user_input="Your task here",
    turn_length=10,           # Max turns (None = unlimited)
    verbose=True,             # Print turn-by-turn output during execution
    temperature=0.7,          # Sampling temperature
    model="openai/gpt-oss-20b",
    reasoning_effort="high",  # For models that support it
    example_id="q0042",       # Optional ID for trace records
    config_path="configs/experiments/gpt_oss_deep_research_bench.yaml",  # Optional override
)

result["final_response"]   # str — the agent's final answer
result["turns"]            # int — how many turns it took
result["tool_calls"]       # int — total tools invoked
result["messages"]         # list — full conversation history
result["trace"]            # EpisodeTrace — complete execution tree
```
